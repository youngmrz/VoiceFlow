### Why Pay for Noise?

Cloud dictation services charge monthly fees while harvesting your voice data. VoiceFlow is free, fully local, and yours forever.

### Unbreakable Privacy

Everything runs on localhost. Your microphone data never leaves your RAM. We can't sell your data because we never see it.

*   **Air-Gapped Safe**: Works completely offline after initial model download.
*   **Open Source**: Audit every line of code yourself.
*   **No Telemetry**: Zero tracking, zero analytics, zero cloud calls.

---

### Battery-Friendly Performance

VoiceFlow uses minimal resources when idle so your laptop stays cool and quiet.

*   **Lazy Loading**: AI model loads only when you need it (2-5 second first-use delay).
*   **Auto-Unload**: Model automatically clears from memory after 5 minutes idle (configurable).
*   **~20 MB Idle**: Minimal memory footprint when not in use.
*   **0% CPU**: No background processing or fan noise while idle.

### How It Works

No hidden processes, no cloud uploads. Just transparent, local AI at every step.

</p>

#### 1. Ready
VoiceFlow waits silently in your system tray using under 20 MB of memory. The AI model loads only when needed.

#### 2. Listening
Activate with your hotkey and speak naturally. Audio stays in RAM only—the interface visualizes your voice amplitude in real-time.

#### 3. Transcribe & Paste
Release the hotkey. Local AI processes your audio (first use takes 2-5s to load model), then auto-pastes text at your cursor. Model stays loaded for 5 minutes, then auto-unloads to free memory.

### Custom Hotkeys

Configure your preferred keyboard shortcuts with two recording modes to match your workflow.

</p>

*   **Hold Mode**: Hold to record, release to transcribe. Perfect for quick dictation bursts.
*   **Toggle Mode**: Press once to start, press again to stop. Ideal for longer recordings.

### Neural Engine

Choose from 16+ Whisper models optimized for different use cases.

#### Model Categories
*   **Standard** (Tiny → Large-v3): From 75MB to 3GB. Balance speed and accuracy for your hardware.
*   **Turbo** (~1.6GB): Best speed-to-quality ratio. Recommended for daily use.
*   **English-only** (.en variants): Optimized specifically for English with improved accuracy.
*   **Distilled**: Faster inference with minimal quality loss.

#### Core Features
*   **99+ Languages**: Automatic language detection built-in.
*   **Custom Hotkeys**: Configure your own shortcuts with Hold or Toggle modes.
*   **Local History**: Searchable SQLite database of all your transcriptions.
*   **Auto-Paste**: Text appears directly at your cursor—no copy-paste needed.
*   **Resource Efficient**: Lazy loading keeps idle usage under 20 MB. Configurable auto-unload timeout (30s to 30 min).
